1.1 A Journey of a Thousand Miles..

* Genome replication is one of the most important tasks carried out in the cell. Before a cell can divide, it must first replicate its Genome so that each of the two daughter cells inherits its own copy.

* Replication begins in a genomic region called the replication origin *(denoted ori)* and is carried out by the molecular copy machines called **DNA polymerases**.

* Locating *ori* presents an important task not only for understanding how cells replicate but also for various biomedical problems. For example, some **gene therapy** methods use genetically engineered mini-genomes, which are called **viral-vectors** because they are able to penetrate cell walls *(just like real viruses)*.

 * The idea of gene therapy it so intentionally infect a patient who lacks a crucial gene with a viral vector containing an artificial gene that encodes a therapeutic protein.

 * To ensure that the vector actually replicates inside the cell, biologists must know where *ori* is in the vector's genome and ensure that the genetic manipulations that they perform do not affect it.

* Mostly to locate *ori* biologist would delete various short segments from the genome in an effort to find a segment whose deletion stops replication.

1.2 Hidden Messages in the Replication Origin
===============

* Finding *ori* in bacterial genomes, most of which consists of a single circular chromosome.

* Research has shown that the region of the bacterial genome encoding *ori* is typically a few hundred nucleotides long. 

* *Vibrio cholerae* is the pathogenic bacteria that causes cholera.
